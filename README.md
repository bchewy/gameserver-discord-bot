This repo consists of a two sections:

1. A simple Python-based discord bot that allows the user to make use of a discord bot as an interface to provision a squad server almost instantly (minus provisioning time).
2. The backend IaC (Infrastructure as Code) to provision the infrastructure specifically on AWS.

Todo:
- Additional support for other cloud providers (Google Cloud Compute, Alibaba, etc)
- Make specific changes for configuration files, specific changes, being able to add an admin/whitelist **via the discord bot**
